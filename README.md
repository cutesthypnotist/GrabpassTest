# GrabpassTest
2019.4.30f1

Emits up to 7 arbitrary fields per vertex of a mesh to screen using grabpass and then reads them back using a camera to perform a computation; however, it is currently broken. Instead we get much triangle soup after reading back computation result from texture. Much sadness.
